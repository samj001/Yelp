Andy's Sushi Bar ain't in the same galaxy.\n\nHowever, I must say, Andy is the man. How can you go wrong with a take-out only sushi restaurant inside the largest fresh fish market in town (Wholey's)? Especially in a town like Pittsburgh which doesn't come to mind when you think fresh sushi.\n\nI've had my fair share of nasty fish around town. Even in some nice places that looked like the fish should have tasted better (and fresher) than it was. Then I found Andy. No frills, no bar, but hey, the fish is as fresh as you're gonna get in these parts of the USA.\n\nPeople seem to line-up for his endless list of rolls - and there are plenty. I never got why someone would order a Fried Chicken Roll. Personally, I prefer the lunch special which includes 8 pieces of nigiri sushi (whatever is fresh that day....usually yellowtail, tuna, salmon and eel), as well as eight pieces of some roll Andy throws together in front of you - like a spicy California Roll or Salmon and Cucumber Roll. You get what he thinks is the freshest catch of the day. Total is around $14.00 for this particular order.\n\nAnd one other word of caution, especially around holidays and on Fridays, Wholey's can be jammed with people - I mean packed - so if you don't like crowds, or if you don't like standing in line to order your food and watch Andy make it fresh - then CALL AHEAD and place your order for pick-up. \n\nThere is also a decent sized dining room upstairs (paper covered tables) that you can eat in if you don't want to take the food to go.", "false positive: ": 5, "false negative: ": 0}

I would have wished each to have a different personality but they all had cheese and a pickle. We liked the chicken best and though the other two were slightly different we couldn't (nor could our server) tell which was which (note to Burgatory - put a different marker on one of them). Sadly they were a bit dry which may not reflect on the regular size burgers that we didn't try. I'm a toppings person when it comes to burgers to that decreased my enjoyment of the selections. A homemade pickles/toppings bar like Michael Symon's B Spot would be welcome. We should have stopped with just these. \n\nMushroom Fries - No - as other reviews highlight the large battered portabello fries and I love mushrooms I was looking forward to but disappointed by these. I was pulling the batter off and then wiping copious grease off my fingers before trying to enjoy the plain mushrooms. Perhaps leaving the gills/underside of the large pieces makes the coating wet when it goes into the frier? Not sure but a mistake. And I love peanut sauce and could discern some peanut-y flavor - maybe from peanut oil - in the dip but I'd call the black thin sauce Asian or Soy or something other than peanut that I expect to be thicker and more peanut-y.\n\nSide of fries - were fine.\n\nWings - these were okay. The skins were a bit rubbery but edible and tasty. We were disappointed though because they were called Siracha Wings which sounded awesome. We expected a spicy, hot and red wing. These were natural colored with a thin Asian style sauce and a sprinkle of sesame seeds and scallions.

{"text": "Soba got a lot really nice reviews so my wife and I decided to try it out while visiting pittsburgh.  The atmosphere and ambience are cool and really nice.  While the portion sizes are large and food is beautifully plated, the dishes really just average. The ingredients and flavors of two dishes we are needed balancing very badly.  If you're sensitive to spicy food beware because every dish was spicy and geared for bold flavor.  We had the Burmese Salad, Miso Black Cod and the Cantonese noodles with beef.  The salad was very creative and with a little tender care and adjustment to the ingredients it could be a really nice dish (too many spices added and too little dressing/vinegarette). The Miso Black Cod filet was the highlight of the dish (prefectly cooked, beautiful taste) but unfortunately it was massively overpowered by the super strong gochujong sauce that drenched the rest of the dish. While the piece of fish was really nice, the rest of the dish was too extreme and lacked the finesse of a decent arrangement.  The Cantonese noodles were pretty good and our favorite out the three dishes.  The beef was nicely marinated and cooked perfectly to give a nice tenderness.  The noodles seemed they provably came from a package and were a bit too thin (unlike traditional beef ho fun) so nothing special there.  \n\nWhile the service was great and the dishes were presented beautifully, the ingredient combinations did not mesh well enough for good fusion with balanced flavors and the prices were too high.", "false positive: ": 0, "false negative: ": 4}

Was up for something new so gave it a try. Dan was behind the counter and I told him I had never been here. He gladly have me a quick but informative rundown of the menu and a couple recommendations. I ended up going with the kalua pork rice bowl and couldn't have been more pleased. A mostly sweet dish with just the right amount of savory. Place was very clean and the menu was very simple to navigate. They have a selection of hot and soy sauces to add to your dish but I didn't find them necessary.

It's quite possibly the best tasting pancake I've had.  The edges get crispy and the middle stays soft.  \n\nAtmosphere is what you would likely expect from a dinner: busy, loud, fun.  Don't be intimidated to ask questions or things that you might need. The staff is super nice.  They're just busy trying to keep the place chugging along.  \n\nBRING CASH if you intend to eat at Pamela's.  They are cash only.  \n\nPlan to spend around $10-12 per person.
