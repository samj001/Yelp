Though I find it really hard to believe that they're known for anything. \n\nAs an appetizer we had caprese. It was 12 bucks and came with four tomato slices that were not ripe, four pieces of impostor buffalo mozzarella and a flake of basil. Hands down the worst I have ever had. \n\nNext came the salads. These were made up of a few greens and half a tomato. Seriously? \n\nFor my entree I ordered a mixed veggie type pasta with oil and garlic. 20 bucks down the drain. My boyfriend had the 'special' which was Cioppino. It was 36 dollars and his stomach is feeling ever dollar of it. \n\nWe took our left overs because we just do that and don't want to be wasteful. On the way home the smell of it was so bad we had to pull over to toss it out. \n\nThis place is a crock.

You get what he thinks is the freshest catch of the day. Total is around $14.00 for this particular order.\n\nAnd one other word of caution, especially around holidays and on Fridays, Wholey's can be jammed with people - I mean packed - so if you don't like crowds, or if you don't like standing in line to order your food and watch Andy make it fresh - then CALL AHEAD and place your order for pick-up. \n\nThere is also a decent sized dining room upstairs (paper covered tables) that you can eat in if you don't want to take the food to go.", "actual label": 0, "predict label": 1}

Their standard fries are fine, the pesto aioli on the So-Cal is very tasty, and the ciabatta bun is beautiful.  But when you're paying over $8 for a sandwich its the little things that make you regret not getting something simpler from the menu.  \n\nWe haven't tried the breakfast here, which is apparently what they're known for, so maybe we'll give that a whirl and see if our perspective changes.", "actual label": 0, "predict label": 0}

I'm the friend who makes fun of everyone else for eating things at 0 spiciness. I ordered this dish at a 6, thinking it would be on the hot side of medium spiciness. This was one of the spiciest dishes I have ever been served. It was inedible, because not only was it extremely spicy but the pineapples had been cooked so much they were completely flavorless, which is something I've never experienced before. So there was no balancing sweet flavor, it was just insane spiciness that overwheled everything. I am with a friend who also loves spicy food, and it was too much for him, too. He ordered another dish at a spiciness level of 3, which seemed to have no bite at all. Mine was definitely not twice as spicy as his, it was at least 10 times as spicy. I've ordered 8s and 9s that weren't this hot. He also was weirded out by the totally flavorless pineapple. \n\nMy friend's level 3 completely unspicy dish was fine; it was crab fried rice.

The coconut custard was OK, but not amazing. I've definitely had better. I used to live near Thai Lotus and would frequently get delivery from them; their sticky rice with custard was AMAZING.

The parking lot is shared with the other stores of the mall, but because it was night and most of the commerce around was closed, so we can say that was a \"private\" parking lot.\nThe dining room was an excite place, really remembering a churrascaria on Rio de Janeiro.

Because this is a Brazilian barbeque place, my wife and I went there looking to eat a rodizio.\nOverall, the experience was fantastic! Because they know how to cut the meat on a Brazilian style and they offer Brazilian goodies to consume there too like Guarana or Brazilian coffee.

{"text": "Wow, where to begin?  We just moved to Anthem from Dallas Texas and were looking for a great pizza/Italian place to eat at, but this is NOT the place.  We entered and there were only two other  dinners in the place, one was a family of 5 and the other was a family of 3, we were a party of 2.  We were seated and told that are waitress would be with us in just a minute.  Well, that minute turned out to be about 10 minutes.  Having had time to read the menu about a dozen times while we waited, when our waitress finally did show up we were ready to order but she ask us if we wanted to put in a drink order?  Really???  So we did put in an order for 2 glasses of wine and asked for water as well.  About 10 minutes later we received our wine (very small pour indeed) and no water?  As we were waiting for our food order (I'll get to that train wreck in just a minute) we noticed that the other two occupied tables were having issues with their orders and all we could hear was the waitress consistently apologizing, we also watch as the other tables food was delivered, ONE freaken plate at a time, first one child got some breadsticks, then about 4 minutes later the other child got a salad, then about 10 minutes later the father got his order, then they apparently asked for water and it was delivered ONE glass at a time by the same server (not waiter???) then we experienced the same absolutely mind numbing food delivery, with the exception that I had ordered the 10\" pizza (which was pretty good after a 20 minuet wait) but my wife had ordered a chicken pasta dish, which we never received.  The waitress brought the pizza and two plates and started to walk away and I ask where my wife's meal was and she looked stunned, walked away and came back and told us that she had turned in the order but the \"kitchen\" must have misread it, but she would re-enter the order, well that was about 2 glasses of wine each and one very small pizza later, which had already taken about 55 minutes....duh!  So we simply told her to cancel the order and we would just pay for the pizza and wine and be happy to leave.  It was one of the worst dinning experiences we have ever had.  The \"manager\" was there, tending a small bar, at which NO ONE was sitting, but he did manage to go and clean the back door glass while all of his customers were waiting for service.  It was a totally dysfunctional, totally unacceptable experience and I doubt that we will ever return, unless my wife bets me that it couldn't possible be that bad on a second visit and I might be willing to accept that \"sure bet\"!!!  Unfortunately in Anthem the dinning options are very limited and even the Legend Sports Bar (well, sort of a sports bar) is failing as it changes management???  I ordered a pizza there last  week and was told after a 15 minute wait that they had no cheese for the pizza because the whole kitchen/management team just weren't ordering any food?

Our last few visits, today and last week were not good at all.  First off the salad bowl used to be filled almost to the top with greens, last two visits there were a good 1 1/2\" from the top (really?) of course the condiments are alwyas put on with a tiny baby spoon, usually not even half full of content, but I get that and am ok with that, but what also doesn't seem right is that if you get a \"large\" size salad, you still get the small size condiments?  Additionally, the honey mustard dressing must have been diluted because it has absolutely no taste and of course was minimally applied.  Another major concern is that while eating the salad, it seemd very gritty, almost like there was sand or dirt on the leaves?  Bad taste as well.  I used to get the lobster bisque but quite ordering that because it seemd that they putting more filler stuff \"celery\" etc. in it and less pieces of lobster.  The Tomato Basil is still very good so that's my go to for soup, assuming we ever go back.\nAs for customer service?  Spotty at best.  Today the server behind the counter at the soup ask if I wanted any soup, I said yes, a small Tamato Basil.  I got up to the register (very crowded) and there was no soup?  The server of the soup had this blank stare on her face like \"did you want soup\"?  Then the cash registers were not working properly and we stood at the counter with our soup getting colder by the minute and 4 to 5 minutes later we finally got to sit and eat.  Only other comment (not a good one) is that the water out of one of the soft drink dispenser tasted very bad?  Not sure why but certainly something to be concerned about.  Well, that's it folks!

Either don't claim to be GF friendly or get some more kitchen help? In the end, I ended up paying a pretty high price for noodles, marinara sauce & grilled chicken :( \n\nOur waitress only smiled when she was dropping off the check & we only smiled when we could finally leave.", "actual label": 1, "predict label": 1}

Even my husband who is the farthest thing from GF or vegan absolutely loved everything we ordered from the raw menu. In my opinion, their chef is one of the most skilled I've ever encountered because they are making delicious dishes that you don't at all feel like you're missing out on stuff from (as you sometimes do with GF/vegan dishes). \n\n- Everything is fairly priced for what you are getting. \n\n- Their raw desserts are AMAZING and have no added sugar! \n\nI love love love Eden- I only wish they had more hours & more locations :)", "actual label": 1, "predict label": 0}

This menu is wonderful, a WIDE variety of things, many I have never seen in Pittsburgh before. We ordered some of every type of meat (the chorizo was our fav!), some wings, guac (delish!) and the plantains for dessert.\n- The waitress was great- I think it would be helpful for them to have more than 1 server for the entire restaurant because the poor girl did look a bit frantic at some points but she handled it well for being the only server there. \n- The cost is super reasonable and allows you to try multiple things on their menu which is great, because believe me, you'll want to. \n\nCan't wait to go back!", "actual label": 1, "predict label": 1}

I asked the waiter to at least bring me some water (I was super dehydrated already) and...NOTHING!!! Finally, at the end of the movie, we complained to the waiter and he said he would get a manager.

I can see why a restaurant might stop advertising a item that is not selling.  But there are few replacement options when you start removing vegetarian choices.  In addition, when I asked if they still made the veggie wrap at all, the bartender simply said no.   I hate the thought of being high maintenance, so I didn't press the issue.

I could taste the different cheeses, the pasta was cooked perfectly, and it melted in my mouth.  My mom ordered a chicken dish and it came with two large chicken breasts and vegetables (she substituted rice for veggies).  Of course, I'm vegetarian and can't eat meat, but the veggies were ridiculous!! They were so delicious.\n\n+ Prices and portions.  Yes, the prices are a tad high, but the portions make it worth it.  I had ten large raviolis stuffed well with mushrooms.  It could easily be split into two meals.\n\n+ Creme brulee.  They have about eight different kinds of creme brulee to choose from.  I ordered the chocolate cake, the original and caramel.  Fantabulous.  Spectacular.  Even if you don't eat a meal here, you MUST try their desserts!!  It will be the best thing you ever do for yourself.", "actual label": 1, "predict label": 0}

They have added different flavors, which are so yummy! Try to spicy pork belly (sam gyop sal) that was recently added it's one of my favorites.\n\nAnd remember when eating meat first order not marinated meats then order marinated because otherwise the marinated meats taste will disrupt the taste of the not marinated meat.   \n\nI must say it's really nice not having to drive to Koreatown for a decent korean bbq place!\n\nOh and all the people who work here are so nice & helpful!

So, why did we have to pay full price to sub them and then not get a side that was supposed to come with our meal?

{"text": "This has been the worst experience I have ever received at a business establishment. So much so that I feel obligated in writing my first Yelp review in the five years since I've been a member.. \n\nThis is how the story goes:\n\nMy girlfriend and I arrived on Saturday 8/26 to watch the Mayweather/McGregor fight. Prior to arriving we called ahead to ask for the cover prices. We were told $10 at 4pm then $20 at 5pm and $30 after 6pm. So fast forward to arriving at the entrance BEFORE 5pm and to my surprise we were told we had to pay $20 since it was beginning to get \"unexpectedly\" crowded. So after we agree to reluctantly pay the cover, we were then told by the hostess that we were highly unlikely to get a table/seats. Granted, this was after we had already payed the cover charge to get in fully expecting to at least be able to sit at the bar. As we enter we realize how insanely crowded it is with no open seats in sight. We could not even order drinks at the bar because it was so crowded. After a brief browse around the area we came to the conclusion that it was just too crowded and it wasn't worth it to stand for who knows how long and wait for open tables/seats. By then we're both irritated and decide to leave after a few minutes of searching for open seats and squeezing through the crowd. \n\nAt this point, we arrive back home (no more than 10 minutes from Sandbar). Still irritated by the fact I had spent $40 for feeling totally uncomfortable and for something I didn't even receive (watch the fight), I call Sandbar in hopes of receiving a refund. We speak to a woman and let her know our situation. She tells us that they should be able to refund us, however because it was too busy they wouldn't be able to do it that day and to call and speak to a manager tomorrow. We make sure to let her know that we would be able to drive back and show our receipt if that would make it easier, but she continues to encourage us to call and speak to a manager tomorrow. \n\nSo we call back the next day to speak to a manger, however we are told that the manager who handles refunds was not there and to call back tomorrow. \n\nSo then we call back the following day, and to our surprise the manager who handles refunds was still not there and that he would be in the next day.\n\nIt's now Tuesday, and thankfully the manager we are waiting to speak to, Steve, is finally in. My girlfriend explains the situation and how we've been waiting days to speak to him and get our refund. Initially, Steve offers to give us a $40 gift card, however at this point we just want our money back. Steve tells my girlfriend he will call her back to let her know his verdict. Finally he calls back and VERY RUDELY tells her that he is NOT going to refund our money and even goes as far to take the $40 gift card off the table. He tells her that at this point, if we are going to want a refund, we must call corporate and immediately hangs up the phone. \n\nSo officially pissed off at this point, I call corporate and leave a message with Natalie explaining the situation. She tells me that I should receive a call back tomorrow. And now the waiting game begins.....\n*This review will be updated as soon as I hear back from someone.*\n\nNOTE: This entire situation has been a mess, and if the owners/leaders of this establishment had any sense of integrity towards their patrons, they would make this right!", "actual label": 1, "predict label": 0}

{"text": "We stopped in because we were told Los Dos Molinos had good food. I am so disappointed in this restaurant. When we first walked in we thought it looked cute, then we began noticing things like the dirty tables and floors that were not being cleared. We were sat at a poorly cleaned table and given sticky menus. They dropped water and chips at our table quickly and then we didnt see our server for several long minutes. The bar was a sore site to look at. Even from a raised chair I couldn't see what alcohol they had. I wasn't enticed to buy anything. The bar counter itself looked extremely dirty as well. I would not have eaten there. The host acted as the bar tender and it was clear he was not trained as a bar tender. He was placing his hands and fingers in dishes and mixes where they should not have been. Their margaritas looked so weak that you could see straight through them. Most drinks were served out of a machine instead of being mixed by a bar tender. The ceiling had wires sticking out of it and there were fridges with open sides that looked gross. Nothing was lit in the bar. It was the last thing anyone would focus on in the restaurant. The cook ran our food to us, and it was apparent that it had been sitting for a while. The plate was extremely hot and the cheese was melted and burned so bad I had to use a steak knife to cut it. I ordered two beef tacos and my date ordered a guacamole tostada with sour cream on the side. My beef tacos were the most tasteless thing I've eaten in a while. I'm not sure how you can make beef so bland and tasteless. The guacamole tostada came with extra guacamole instead of sour cream. It looked like a plate of guacamole with a few beans visible on the side. My date wanted the sour cream she ordered and some lemons, but never even had the chance to request them as we were not checked on a single time after we got our food. Our waters and soda were never refilled, and no service was actually provided. Once we were done we waited just under 20 minutes to be able to pay our bill. We made it blatantly clear we were ready to go and nothing, no one checked on us. Their flan sounded good but I didn't want to wait an hour for an order. When we were finally able to pay, the server, previously absent until now, stood at our table with an iPad we had to pay on until we paid. We were not able to comfortably talk about paying the bill or tipping. The server was nowhere to be found when we needed service, however he wouldn't leave us once they wanted money. We left disappointed and aggravated that our date night was off to a sour start.

I have had the good fortune of experiencing delicacies of different Indian cusines ranging from street/cart food to upscale 5 stars. I know what I am talking about. This place sucks. The food, the service and the ambience. It was a buffet on a weekend. I was given the crappiest of the place to sit although the restaurant was all empty, well I moved to a different place, no big deal. To start with the appetizers, Tandoori chicken was soo bad, it was awfully greasy, bland and tasteless. The pakoda was disgusting. Okay, no big deal, may be the chef had a bad day. Then the main course, chicken still felt uncooked, the curries were so much so like expiered ready to cook recipies, the nan was tougher, thicker and more plastic than my flip flops, oh boy! I was soo disappointed already. Dessert was the only better part of the whole experience, it was really good actually. Well thats about food. The service: this waiter had no welcoming attitude, no smile no nothing. He comes to my table to clear the food, and takes my plate in his hand clears all the scrap from the plate right beside the table into his cleaning basket with his knee on my opposite chair. I was like, wtf!?? I felt disgusted. You dont have to be a huge hotelier to understand such fundemental aspects of a waiting job. At one point I was working as a waiter and I never would do that. Now the ambience: they basically play crappy, cheesy indian dance and sing routines from the 70's and 80's and that too in full volme.

{"text": "First time there, my girlfriend and I sat at the bar. no welcome or is this your first time here? Ordered drinks and looked at the menu, no recommendations from him. You would think that as a new place only 2months old they would be more in your face of the house specials. He was too busy looking at he's phone then talking to us. Ordered the Carpaccio, bland and I felt like it was made earlier in the day, Stuck to the plate and had no flavor. Bartender was lame, tall guy, mid 30's to 40's couldn't care. Watch servers walk up to the wait station eating food asking for bev. to wash it down. Just bad!! I was told by all the few people that I asked about this place, all was bad ! I wanted to see for my self since the have a very good reputation. This place is not good,no atmosphere and really bad service!! Why wouldn't you tell your staff to ask if this is your first time here and to recommend something??? We didn't even get bread service? First and last time here!!", "actual label": 1, "predict label": 0}

{"text": "I was in the mood for a burger and thought I would give this place a try based on reviews and being in close proximity.\nThe atmosphere is good, but the hostess that seated me looked more like a customer and was busy talking to a friend.  I ordered the 5 oz Relapse Know Poblano Burger cooked medium wrapped in lettuce with the Sweet poToToes.  I was surprised how quick it came out and after my first bite, it was obviously undercooked.  Basically it was lightly browned on the outside and cold and raw in the middle.  I sent it back and it was replaced with no problem, but still more on the medium rare side than medium.  The sweet potato Tots were ok, but I think they could offer something of better quality.\nI was not impressed enough to go back and prefer the burgers and fries at Red Robin over the Rehab Burger Therapy.", "actual label": 1, "predict label": 1}
