We entered and there were only two other  dinners in the place, one was a family of 5 and the other was a family of 3, we were a party of 2.  We were seated and told that are waitress would be with us in just a minute.  Well, that minute turned out to be about 10 minutes.  Having had time to read the menu about a dozen times while we waited, when our waitress finally did show up we were ready to order but she ask us if we wanted to put in a drink order?  Really???  So we did put in an order for 2 glasses of wine and asked for water as well.  About 10 minutes later we received our wine (very small pour indeed) and no water?  As we were waiting for our food order (I'll get to that train wreck in just a minute) we noticed that the other two occupied tables were having issues with their orders and all we could hear was the waitress consistently apologizing, we also watch as the other tables food was delivered, ONE freaken plate at a time, first one child got some breadsticks, then about 4 minutes later the other child got a salad, then about 10 minutes later the father got his order, then they apparently asked for water and it was delivered ONE glass at a time by the same server (not waiter???) then we experienced the same absolutely mind numbing food delivery, with the exception that I had ordered the 10\" pizza (which was pretty good after a 20 minuet wait) but my wife had ordered a chicken pasta dish, which we never received.  The waitress brought the pizza and two plates and started to walk away and I ask where my wife's meal was and she looked stunned, walked away and came back and told us that she had turned in the order but the \"kitchen\" must have misread it, but she would re-enter the order, well that was about 2 glasses of wine each and one very small pizza later, which had already taken about 55 minutes....duh!  So we simply told her to cancel the order and we would just pay for the pizza and wine and be happy to leave.  It was one of the worst dinning experiences we have ever had.  The \"manager\" was there, tending a small bar, at which NO ONE was sitting, but he did manage to go and clean the back door glass while all of his customers were waiting for service.

{"text": "This has been the worst experience I have ever received at a business establishment. So much so that I feel obligated in writing my first Yelp review in the five years since I've been a member.. \n\nThis is how the story goes:\n\nMy girlfriend and I arrived on Saturday 8/26 to watch the Mayweather/McGregor fight. Prior to arriving we called ahead to ask for the cover prices. We were told $10 at 4pm then $20 at 5pm and $30 after 6pm. So fast forward to arriving at the entrance BEFORE 5pm and to my surprise we were told we had to pay $20 since it was beginning to get \"unexpectedly\" crowded. So after we agree to reluctantly pay the cover, we were then told by the hostess that we were highly unlikely to get a table/seats. Granted, this was after we had already payed the cover charge to get in fully expecting to at least be able to sit at the bar. As we enter we realize how insanely crowded it is with no open seats in sight. We could not even order drinks at the bar because it was so crowded. After a brief browse around the area we came to the conclusion that it was just too crowded and it wasn't worth it to stand for who knows how long and wait for open tables/seats. By then we're both irritated and decide to leave after a few minutes of searching for open seats and squeezing through the crowd. \n\nAt this point, we arrive back home (no more than 10 minutes from Sandbar). Still irritated by the fact I had spent $40 for feeling totally uncomfortable and for something I didn't even receive (watch the fight), I call Sandbar in hopes of receiving a refund. We speak to a woman and let her know our situation. She tells us that they should be able to refund us, however because it was too busy they wouldn't be able to do it that day and to call and speak to a manager tomorrow. We make sure to let her know that we would be able to drive back and show our receipt if that would make it easier, but she continues to encourage us to call and speak to a manager tomorrow. \n\nSo we call back the next day to speak to a manger, however we are told that the manager who handles refunds was not there and to call back tomorrow. \n\nSo then we call back the following day, and to our surprise the manager who handles refunds was still not there and that he would be in the next day.\n\nIt's now Tuesday, and thankfully the manager we are waiting to speak to, Steve, is finally in. My girlfriend explains the situation and how we've been waiting days to speak to him and get our refund. Initially, Steve offers to give us a $40 gift card, however at this point we just want our money back. Steve tells my girlfriend he will call her back to let her know his verdict. Finally he calls back and VERY RUDELY tells her that he is NOT going to refund our money and even goes as far to take the $40 gift card off the table. He tells her that at this point, if we are going to want a refund, we must call corporate and immediately hangs up the phone. \n\nSo officially pissed off at this point, I call corporate and leave a message with Natalie explaining the situation. She tells me that I should receive a call back tomorrow. And now the waiting game begins.....\n*This review will be updated as soon as I hear back from someone.*\n\nNOTE: This entire situation has been a mess, and if the owners/leaders of this establishment had any sense of integrity towards their patrons, they would make this right!", "actual label": 0, "predict label": 1}

First is was the glass I was drinking out of had lipstick stains on the rim, so I re-ordered a new clean glass of soda. I wasn't upset or throw a fit about it, but as soon as I turned my back at the counter the girls there instantly started complaining about it. They didn't seem to care that I could hear them, but I didn't bother. But as we got our meal, two orders weren't right the waitress had to re order and resubmit our ticket. So we waited another 30 minutes, by then everyone was done eating. I again let it slide, but when the waitress served us our meal she looked at me and with an attitude she asked \"is there anything I can get for you your highness?\" Instantly I was upset and requested to speak to a manager. When the manager came she instantly said \"what is it now?!\" I replied \"what is your issue with me? We just asked for our meal and the two orders were wrong and I had to reorder a clean glass of soda. I did nothing wrong and I didn't throw a fit.\" Instantly she stated that according to her staff I was being rude and demanding and my staff does not need that kind of attitude from anyone. I told her over and over again that I didn't give any of your staffs members any attitude and nor was I rude. She asked if there was anything else I would like and turned away to go back to the kitchen. So when we got the bill we were charged for the re orders and the clean glass of soda and they automatically added the gratuity to the order. I was so upset I just paid to get out of there and I never felt so humiliated and felt that it was u fair that I paid for the full meal and their mistake and not to mention the attitude from the staff.

We never waited on anything and he kept us in the loop about the status of all the different small plates we ordered (there was 6 of us)\n\nThe idea of a mushroom bar is unique in itself.  I like how you can pick one large or 3 smaller mushrooms.  The choice of toppings is incredible!  I gave this restaurant only 4 stars because we were only there once.  Even though we don't live close, we will be back and I would think the # of stars would raise to 5.  Especially if we get James as our server again.", "actual label": 0, "predict label": 1}

Today I went and ordered a single Double Chalupa, 10 minutes later I went back up and they said \"they're making it now\"...seriously? A one item order and they wait till someone is basically out the door to make it. The best part when I said \"don't worry about making it just give me my money back\" they looked like I just asked them the mathematical formula for calculating the speed of light.

We got the fried chicken livers and Cobb salad and then the steak for two with a chocolate dessert. All of it tasted delicious - well seasoned and generous portions on the sides.

The chili garlic noodles were tasty, but we initially thought there was a mistake with our order since we could not see any chicken in it.  On close inspection, we noticed a few miniscule pieces of chicken... The shrimp chop suey was about average, although the few shrimp were rather small. The garlic pepper chicken was neither garlicky nor peppery, instead swimming in a pool of watery gravy.

These were completely bland, and we had to resort to adding more than a few dollops of the 6 sauces at the table to pretend we were having Indo-Chinese cuisine.\n\nWe wished the portions were more generous, like we get at most Chinese restaurants.

They were happy to do it and did not charge anything extra for it unlike many other sushi places that will add an extra charge. Once again we really appreciate the customer service. \n     Another thing they have is a Sunday brunch all you can eat sushi offering. This is unusual in Arizona and love that they do it. Going out for sushi can often add up quick no matter were you go and for what a few rolls might cost you could do all you can eat at Kawaii during Sunday brunch.  Now they do limit the sashimi to 4 slices of each type of fish but no limit on rolls or nigiri and furthermore it includes for no additional charge some appetizers and drink options as well which makes it a nice experience.", "actual label": 1, "predict label": 1}
{"text": "Enjoyed Greektown.  Much better than other Greek places around that we have tried.  Did feel it was just slightly overpriced compared to portion but food was quite good. \n     I love cheesecake and was a little surprised they had a cheesecake as an option for dessert and it is clearly home made because they were baking it and had to see if it was done before we could order it. It was an exceptional cheesecake but also a little different than the usual cheesecake.  Guessing there is Greek yogurt in there but not sure.  Anyways, delicious!  \n     This is a family run place so in my book that is a plus.  We left payment and tip on the table and left.  Next thing we know the owner George comes out into the parking lot to catch us to say thank you and goodbye.  Most places would not do that. Clearly shows they care.", "actual label": 1, "predict label": 0}

I find this highly offense and unprofessional, it makes me extremely uncomfortable and I also wonder what comments he has made about my body sexually.\nAll of the hostesses there are nice, friendly and full of smiles, except one, I dont know her name either. She is mexican, and last time I was in there she was handing out food, which was new, considering she is the girl who never smiles and makes it seem like it's a painful task to seat me. She always glares at me, never smiles, sighs when I let her know how many people are in my party and lazily walks us to our table. However, every other hostess I have ever come across here is all smiles, courteous and just as friendly as the servers.\n\nA couple bad apples can surely affect business, I know I avoid going to this establishment on certain days due to those specific employees. I have even mentioned something to the General Manager who simply replied, \"That is just who they are.\", with a smile on her face, like it wasn't a big deal and walked away.
